# Personal Introduction

I am broadly interested in cetacean ecology and biology, and anthropogenic impacts on coastal cetaceans. Specifically, I am employing biogeochemical techniques to elucidate the effect of anthropogenic fishery on the niche exploitation in coastal cetacean. The same technique is also applied to identify the weaning age of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin (*Sousa chinensis*).
